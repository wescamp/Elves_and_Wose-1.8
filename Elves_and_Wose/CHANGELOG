TODO:

- balance
- more enemy variation?
	: currently I feel that there a lot to many orcs
	>> but how to insert other races?!?
- balance
- give saleh a full backstory, why is he exiled in the glyns forest?
	: probaly he is a son/grandson of someone that joined Landar, but then why he helps kalenz?
	>> he maybe helps kalenz to 'clean' up his reputation (of traitor) along the other elves...
- balance
- how kalenz and saleh know each other?
- balance
- get rid of that constant religion references...? ("Eloh , here" "Eloh, there", "I go to the spirit world" ... :(
