>  2_Glyns_Castle.cfg
　 Line 187 : id=kalenz → id=Kalenz
»» fixed

>  8_Gitamoth_Forest.cfg
　 "filter" tags around line 260 should be commented out,
　 because they interrupt the "enemies defeated" event.
»» fixed

>  13_North_Spring.cfg
　 Around Line 45, name defining script should be inserted.
　 name=_"Uradredia"
»» added name

>  21_Return_to_Kalian.cfg
　 {NEW_LEADER (...)} in Line 84 kills all side 1 units except for Saleh.
　 Accounting for the meaning of the code, it seems to be unintended.
　 So I think the line should be commented out.
　 I've tested and think that the change makes no harm in proceeding the campaign.
»» Macro is correct

There could be some points to be improved but it doesn't matter so much.
»» critics are always welcome

I enjoyed the campaign and hope it maintained long.
